<h1>Android App Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Handling of sensitive data</h2>

<p>Our apps may request permissions to use data from camera sensor. This data is handled as personal and sensitive information and our apps will not send camera data from your device unless you explicitly share a photo using the sharing functions of the app.</p>

<h2>Advertising identifier</h2>

<p>Our apps display advertising managed by Google’s AdMob advertising network. Therefore our apps use Google Advertising ID, Google’s anonymous identifier for advertising. You can reset your advertising ID at any time using the Google Settings app on your Android device. You can also opt out of interest-based advertising using the same app.</p>

<h2>App analytics</h2>

<p>Our apps use Google Analytics to collect non-personal information, such as device model, device OS version, usage information (e.g. which photo filters are used) and approximate location (country, city). The analytics data does not identify you individually. We use this data to improve our apps. We may also use Google Analytics to collect advertising ID’s for future ad targeting.</p>

<h2>Sharing data</h2>

<p>We share our analytical data with Google. For information on how Google uses data collected by our apps, please visit How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps.</p>

<p>Updated March 8, 2017. We reserve the right to change this policy.</p>
